# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

- `npm run compile` — Build TypeScript from `src/` to `out/`
- `npm run watch` — Rebuild on file changes
- `npm run package` — Package as `.vsix` for distribution

No test framework or linter is configured.

**Version bumps**: When bumping the version number, update it in **all** locations: `package.json`, `README.md`, and any other files that reference the version. Search the repo to ensure nothing is missed.

**Important**: After every code change, always compile, package, and install the extension into VS Code:
```
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.vsix" -delete && npm run compile && npm run package && code --install-extension *.vsix --force
```

**Before committing**: Always launch an independent subagent to audit the staged diff before running `git commit`. The subagent should review the changes, read relevant surrounding files for full context, and check for bugs, logic gaps, unintended side effects, and issues beyond just the changed lines. The audit's final step is a PII sweep: this repository is public, so no real names, device names, other project names, private links, or email addresses may appear in code, comments, docs, examples, or commit messages — use generic placeholders (`MyApp`, `"My MacBook Pro"`). Only commit after the audit passes clean.

## Architecture

VS Code extension that parses Xcode `.xcodeproj` files and generates `Package.swift` manifests and build/debug task configurations for iOS simulator development. Requires macOS with Xcode installed. No runtime dependencies — only VS Code API and Node.js built-ins.

**Data flow**: Read `project.pbxproj` (ASCII plist) → regex-based parsing into structured data → formatted Swift/JSON output → diff view → user confirmation → write file. Bidirectional: `.swift` file additions/removals are synced back into `project.pbxproj` via string manipulation.

### Entry Point

`src/extension.ts` — Orchestrator (~1500 lines) that registers all commands, providers, and watchers. Contains two main workflows:

1. **generatePackageSwift** — Parses pbxproj, builds Package.swift, configures SourceKit-LSP for iOS simulator SDK
2. **configureBuildTasks** — Interactive setup of project/target/scheme/simulator, stores `BuildTaskConfig` to workspace state

Also contains inline helpers: `parseDefaultLocalization`, `parseDeploymentTargets`, `parseExcludedFiles`, `generateCSettings`, `formatProductType`, `printToSharedPanel`, `cancelActiveRun`, `executeTaskAndWait`.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `vsxcode.createFromXcodeproj` | Generate Package.swift (Debug config) |
| `vsxcode.createFromXcodeprojWithOptions` | Generate Package.swift (QuickPick config selection) |
| `vsxcode.generateBuildTasks` | Interactive build task configuration |
| `vsxcode.sidebar.*` | 15 sidebar commands: changeProject, changeTarget, changeScheme, changeBundleId, toggleDevBundleId (+ enableDevBundleId/disableDevBundleId inline wrappers), uninstallStaleAppsOnSimulator, selectSimulator, changeSwiftVersion, changeStrictConcurrency, build, buildAndRun, refresh, cleanDerivedData |

### Key Patterns

- **Build settings inheritance**: Debug/Release configs merge with project-level defaults via `mergeWithInherited`, respecting `$(inherited)`
- **Resource classification**: Files classified as `.process` (compilable: xcassets, storyboard, xib, strings, xcdatamodeld) or `.copy` (everything else)
- **Filesystem scanning**: After pbxproj parsing, `scanForUnhandledFiles` walks target directories to auto-exclude Xcode-specific files (Info.plist, .entitlements, .pch) and auto-include bundle-like resource directories (.xcdatamodeld, .xcassets, .lproj, etc.) that SPM can't auto-categorize
- **Auto-sync (pbxproj → Package.swift)**: FileSystemWatcher on `*.pbxproj` triggers silent Package.swift regeneration
- **Auto-sync (Swift files → pbxproj)**: FileSystemWatcher on `*.swift` detects file create/delete in target directories and updates pbxproj (4 entries: PBXBuildFile, PBXFileReference, PBXGroup, PBXSourcesBuildPhase). Handles subdirectories via PBXGroup tree resolution. Debounced (300ms) with write serialization.
- **Auto-sync (Core Data models → pbxproj)**: FileSystemWatcher on `*.xcdatamodeld` treats the bundle as one unit (the directory, not the files inside) and updates 5 structures: PBXBuildFile, a `wrapper.xcdatamodel` PBXFileReference per version, PBXGroup child, PBXSourcesBuildPhase entry (momc compiles models — Sources, not Resources), and the XCVersionGroup, whose section markers are created on the first model and dropped with the last. `children`/`currentVersion` come from the bundle's `.xccurrentversion`, falling back to the sole version; a bundle whose versions drift from what pbxproj records is re-registered, since a `currentVersion` pointing at a missing version is the same momc failure as no entry at all. Both events run the same routine and decide from disk rather than the event kind, so a rename or atomic replace settles correctly. Shares the swift sync's debounce and write queue.
- **Core Data codegen (SourceKit-LSP)**: models with class/category codegen get their NSManagedObject subclasses generated only by Xcode's build, so the SwiftPM-based LSP build can't resolve them. `generatePackageSwift` runs momc per target with a data model into `~/Library/Developer/VSCode/DerivedSources/<workspaceKey>/<Target>/` and folds the files into the module via an `.unsafeFlags` entry interpolating a `coreDataGenerated` preamble variable (`Context.environment["HOME"]` — documented PackageDescription API). SwiftPM folding positional source paths from unsafeFlags is undocumented behavior, accepted deliberately: the repository, the model file, and pbxproj stay untouched, so the Xcode build/archive pipeline can never be affected — the failure mode is LSP squiggles, never builds. momc failure → manifest emitted without flags. Regen triggers: activation, pbxproj changes, bundle create/delete, model-contents edits (`**/*.xcdatamodeld/**` watcher — entity edits never touch pbxproj), the manual Sync Files command, and Clean DerivedData (wipe + immediate regen). Manifest generation is serialized per workspace; codegen runs are serialized module-wide and land via staging-dir rename so the LSP never observes a half-populated directory. Each output dir carries a `manifest.json` recording what was emitted, and every generation pass garbage-collects stale outputs — a deleted/renamed input or disabled codegen removes its derived files (legacy all-`.swift` dirs included), an emptied tree is removed marker and all, and anything not recognizable as extension output is left in place and logged.
- **Reconcile**: `vsxcode.syncProjectFiles` (and activation) catches up on changes the watchers missed. Swift files are add-only; Core Data models are also removed when the bundle is gone from disk, since a stale XCVersionGroup fails the build with momc's "No current version for model". Removal requires the model to be absent both at its resolved path and by name, so an unresolvable group tree is never read as a deletion.
- **Auto-configure**: On activation, auto-detects first project/target/simulator and stores `BuildTaskConfig` to workspace state
- **Task chaining**: build-install completion triggers run-and-debug; debug session end kills debugserver
- **Physical device support**: Build → install via devicectl → poll device ready → launch console → attach lldb-dap
- **SourceKit-LSP**: Auto-configures `swift.sourcekit-lsp.serverArguments` with iOS simulator SDK paths for intellisense
- **swift-format**: Auto-detects binary, discovers workspace/project config files, format-on-save via DocumentFormattingEditProvider, webview UI for rule configuration in sidebar
- **XCTest integration**: Discovers test targets from pbxproj, runs via xcodebuild, parses results (xcresulttool), xccov code coverage
- **Diff view**: Shows current vs generated Package.swift before overwriting
- **Activation**: `workspaceContains:**/*.pbxproj` and `onDebug`
